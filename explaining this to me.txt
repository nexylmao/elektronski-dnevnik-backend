Well, there should be first, security database, it should no matter what, just keep the database of all users ever.
It has 5 types of account, "Student" === "Parent", ones that should be able only to see grades of theirs/their kids.
"Profesor" Should be able to see grades of classes they teach, and 

These objects will only serve to have profile data, stuff like username, email, passwords, and fullname.

That's one database,
onto the next one, the meta one:
It will have two collections, Parents and SchoolYears
Parents will forever have in their 'kids' arrays usernames of their kids
And SchoolYears will be keeping the data on which moderators/profesors worked at that time, if the SchoolYear is active
and which facilities were active in the application at that time

Then, each schoolyear will have it's own database,
it will have a few collections:
Classes :
    which will contain data on the name of the class, their hometeacher, all the subjects,
Grades :
    which one, to who, by who, points, comment, when for which subject and that
Subject :
    what subjects were active this year, and which profesors teached which one, and also the minimum amount of grades
    a student needed to have for the half in that subject
